Blazorade Bootstrap
===================

Bootstrap components implemented as Razor components for Blazor applications. For details, visit the [Blazorade Bootstrap Wiki](https://github.com/Blazorade/Blazorade-Bootstrap/wiki).

Also check out this [preview documentation](https://www.blazorade.com/Bootstrap) for Blazorade Bootstrap on [Blazorade.com](https://www.blazorade.com). That documentation is based on the XML documentation in the source code. The entire site is built with Blazorade Bootstrap as a Blazor WebAssembly application with PWA support.
